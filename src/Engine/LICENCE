	Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be 
	educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun. 
	Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge 
	that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of 
	your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
	github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this

	Background
	~~~~~~~~~~
	Whilst waiting for TheMexicanRunner to start the finale of his NesMania project,
	his Twitch stream had a counter counting down for a couple of hours until it started.
	With some time on my hands, I thought it might be fun to see what the graphical
	capabilities of the console are. Turns out, not very much, but hey, it's nice to think
	Wolfenstein could have existed a few years earlier, and in just ~200 lines of code.
