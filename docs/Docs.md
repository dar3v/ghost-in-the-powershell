# GHOST in the POWERSHELL documentation

**GHOST in the POWERSHELL** is a 3D Maze Command-Line Game made possible with the ray casting tech inspired from classic games like *[Wolfenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D#Development)* and *[DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game))*.

find the statue in each 3 levels to finish the game. Do it before the timer however, because if your time is out, its game over! ðŸ‘»
